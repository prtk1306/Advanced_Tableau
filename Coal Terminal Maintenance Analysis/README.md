## Coal Terminal Maintenance Analysis Challenge - Advanced Tableau

You have been hired  by a  Coal Terminal to access which of their Coal Reclaimer machines requires maintenance in the upcoming month.

These machine runs literally round the clock 24/7 for 365 days a year. Every minute of downtime equates to millions of dollars lost revenue, that is why it is crucial to identify exactly when these machines require maintenance (neither less or more frequently is acceptable.

Currently, the Coal terminal follows the following criterion: a reclaimer-type machine requires maintenance when within the previous month there was at least one-8-hour period when the average idle capacity was over 10%.

Idle Capacity is a utilization metric which, for the purpose of this project, is defined as:
Idle Capacity = (Actual Tonnage - Normal Capacity)/Normal Capacity

Your task is to find out which of the 5 machines have been exceeded this level and create a report for the executive stakeholders with your recommendations.
